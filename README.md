Quickly create Table-of-Content Markdown for GitHub Markdown files.

## Overview

> I could never find an easy to use, online table-of-content maker for GitHub Markdown files. There were many solutions that required downloading or installing something on my computer. For such a trivial task I felt that was unnecessary.

I fully agree. This is a fork, with no Google Analytics and some bugfixes.

**None of your data is transferred to the Internet.** All work happens in your browser, using JavaScript.

I did lots of testing and rewrote the link generation to be as compatbile with GitHub as possible. So far it works great, even for difficult cases.

## Test file

[testing.md](testing.md) is a sample Markdown file with many test cases. Copy its contents into the input box of gh-toc to see what gets generated.
