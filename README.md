# gh-toc

a simple web page to quickly create table of content markdown for GitHub markdown files

## Overview

> I could never find an easy to use, online table-of-content maker for GitHub markdown files. There were many solutions that required downloading or installing something on my computer. For such a trivial task I felt that was unnecessary.
> _â€” (Words from the original creator)_

I fully agree. This is just a fork for my use, with no Google Analytics and some bugfixes.

This page just uses JavaScript to extract headings from a markdown file and return table-of-content markdown.

## Test file

[testing.md](testing.md) is a short test file with a lot of odd characters. Copy its contents into the input box of gh-toc to see what gets generated.
