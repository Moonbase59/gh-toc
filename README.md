# nGitHubTOC

a simple web page to quickly create table of content markdown for GitHub markdown files

## Overview

I could never find an easy to use, online table-of-content maker for GitHub markdown files. There were many solutions that required downloading or installing something on my computer. For such a trivial task I felt that was unnecessary. 

This page just uses JavaScript to extract headings from a markdown file and return table-of-content markdown.
